### Arabic Translations

Arabic Translations for Frappe, ERPNext, HR and CRM

### What it does

- Provides Arabic translations for Frappe, ERPNext, and HRMS.
- On install, auto-detects the Frappe major version (v15 or v16) and copies the matching Arabic locale bundle for each installed app from `arabic_translations/locale/other-apps/{version}` into the app’s `locale/` or `translations/` folder (`ar.po` or `ar.csv`). Existing files are overwritten to ensure fresh strings.
